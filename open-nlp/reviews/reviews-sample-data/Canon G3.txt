picure[+2]##jus a lile overview , powersho g3 is he flagship of canon 's powersho series and is an slr-like camera , is 4 megapixel and ( alsmos ) full manual conrol gives he picures a ouch of brilliance . 
use[+1]##wheher you are a novice or an exper , is ease of use and funcionaliy goes ogeher . 
##+ you can have differen kind of lens if you wan + flashes , ec. 
##as is 4mp , you migh need bigger sorage o sore high qualiy images and recording movies ( you can record 3 minues of video ) . 
##i am using kingson 512mb cf which works grea and is very fas . 
##a good choice could be cf ype ii , microdrives ha can sore around 1 gb of images . 
##some hings ha i did n' like ( bu hey . nohing is perfec ). 
dial[-1]##* main dial is no backli . 
viewfinder[-2]##* lens visible in opical viewfinder . 
##( well has only for old-school die-hard opical viewfinder fans ) use lcd insead which is brillian and you can wis around oo . 
camera[+2][p]##overall i 'm happy wih my oy . 
canon g3 ? incredible camera 
##i did exensive research comparing differen 4 and 5 megapixel cameras . 
##a couple of online camera review sies were exremely helpful , as hey provided complee exhausive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a grea number of high resoluion sample images o compare amongs he models . 
##following my research , i decided on he g3 . 
camera[+3]##in a word , " awesome " is how i would describe his camera . 
speed[+2],picure qualiy[+2],funcion[+2]##i wo n' go ino he deails here , as he online sies ( sevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go ino grea deph in heir reviews , bu i am very pleased wih he feaures , he speed , he picure qualiy , he flexibiliy , he auomaion , and he funcional conveniences his camera offers . 
auo seing[+2]##wih he auomaic seings , i really have n' aken a bad picure ye . 
##and wih he panoramic " sich " mode , i guides you hrough siching ogeher muliple picures o build a seamless panoramic image .

phoo qualiy[+2]##i have aken hundreds of phoos wih i and i coninue o be amazed by heir qualiy . 
feaure[+2]##he g3 is loaded wih many useful feaures , and unlike many smaller digial cameras , i is easy o hold seady when using slower shuer speeds . 
##flaws ? 
viewfinder[-1]##he lens is visible in he viewfinder when he lens is se o he wide angle , bu since i use he lcd mos of he ime , his is no really much of a boher o me . 
##sill i am a lile suprised ha canon did no correc his design flaw before releasing he camera . 
camera[+2]##despie his minor disappoinmen , i highly recommend he canon g3 anyone who is serious abou digial phoography . 
have n' had pracice bu i 'm already in love wih i 
camera[+2]##i have only had his camera for one full day and i have o say ha i is wonderful . 
phoo qualiy[+3]##he phoo qualiy is amazing and i know i 'm going o have fun wih all he feaures . 
##i 've figured ou mos of is feaures on my own already ( because i have used digial cameras before , so i know hings like symbols ) . 
##i 'm one of hose people ha can only concenrae on one screen a a ime so i 've been having rouble paying aenion o he lile display panel on op , bu ha does n' sop me from loving his camera . 
darn dioper adjusmen dial[-1]##he reason i raed i a four is because of ha darn dioper adjusmen dial. is very small and hard o urn so you can ' ge an accurae adjusmen ( for hose of you who do n' know wha a dioper adjusmen is , i is o adjus he focus of he viewfinder o your eyesigh . ) 
##i am going o have so much fun wih his camera and when i learn more i will pos a more accurae review . 
excellen for he semi-serious amaeur 
##posiives

##4 ) he grea hing abou digial , in general , is ha you can generally see he resuls of your exposure seings on he lcd screen before you ake he picure , no wo weeks laer when you ge he film developed . 
focus[+2]##5 ) is focusing sysem is also very flexible . 
focus[+2]##you can move he focus range o almos anywhere in he scene wih he push of a buon , and i has an on-screen manual focus mode ha would be really helpful if shooing a scene ha is ough o auomaically focus . 
##negaives 
size[-2][u],weigh[-2][u]##1 ) quie bulky ( i 's abou he same size as my minola vecis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy baery , alhough no very solid as i is conruced mosly of plasic ( unlike canon 's elph line ) 
design[-2][u]##2 ) no very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a poin-and-shoo lens ) 
viewfinder[-2]##4 ) he viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying . 
fanasic digial camera 
feaure[+2], ##he camera has a wonderful se of feaures . 
lcd[+2]##he lcd screen pulls ou and roaes in any direcion for easy picures . 
##you can even ake a picure of yourself while looking a he lcd . 
opical zoom[+2],digial zoom[+1]##he opical zoom works grea and he 14x digial zoom is a very nice addiion alhough picures a he highes digial zoom are a lile blurry . 
picure[+3]##he highes opical zoom picures are perfec . 
picure[+3]##i have no ye seen any of he usual problems wih digial picures ( purple fringing , ec ) so i am very pleased . 
sofware[+2]##he canon compuer sofware used o download , sor , upload and manage your digial picures on he compuer is very nice and very easy o use . 
lens cap[-1],viewfinder[-1]##he only wo minor issues i have wih he camera are he lens cap ( i is no very snug and can come off oo easily ) and he lens iself ( i parially obsrucs he view hrough he viewfinder bu no views hrough he lcd ) . 
menu[+1],buon[+1]##he menus are easy o navigae and he buons are easy o use . 
camera[+3]##i is a fanasic camera and well worh he price . 
he bes of everyhing 
camera[+3]##recen price drops have made he g3 he bes bargain in digial cameras currenly available . 
conrol[+2]##advanced phoobugs will find more creaive conrol han imaginable . 
auo seing[+2]##newbies will find he full auo seing will give hem perfec picures righ ou of he box . 
phoo qualiy[+3]##4 megapixels is enough for anybody and he phoo qualiy is awesome . 
##do n' ge fooled by he 5 megapixel markeing hype . 
##unless you wan o prin murals , you do n' need i .

pure class & qualiy - a work of crafmanship 
camera[+3]##i recommend unreservedly he powersho g3 o any poenial buyer looking for a firs-class digial camera a a reasonable price - here is no beer camera ou here - period ! 
picure[+3], conrol[+2], baery[+2], sofware[+2]##i gives grea picures , he conrols are easy o use , he baery lass forever on one single charge , he sofware is very user-friendly and i is beauiful in i chrome casing . 
phoo qualiy[+2], auo mode[+2]##i began aking pics as soon as i go his camera and am amazed a he qualiy of phoos i have ook simply by using he auo mode . 
##absoluely breahaking . 
##i was considering he olympus camedia c-5050 bu was convinced o buy he g3 afer visiing a sore and holding i in my hands and rying i ou . 
##he olympus is a bi clumsy-looking and he user-inerface no as friendly as he canon , bu one of he feaures ha sold me on he g3 was he baery life - no oher camera ou here gives you he ype of baery life as he canon g3 . 
##i would recommend a larger compac-flash card , a leas 128 mb . 
##i bough a 512 mb card by simpleech and i works grea wih my canon . 
grea camera 
##wha else can you say abou a camera ha works for boh of you ? 
##i make phoographs a work , and so waned a camera good enough o compare wih wha i use professionally . 
##a he same ime , i waned my wife o no be inimidaed by knobs and buons . 
##i recieved he camera , insered a larger cf card , charged he baery , and handed i o my wife . 
##i showed her how o urn i on , where he lens zoom lever is , and she loves i ! 
canera[+2]##his camera has canon 's grea colorimery , plus wha you see in he lcd is wha you ge . 
prin[+2]##he prins are beauiful ! 
##and you ge abou 120 images on a 256mb card a highes qualiy . 
##i ried ou some oher brands in he sores , and was disappoined by he baery life of he oher company ; plus wha you see in he lcd ( no opical finder ) is n' wha you ge - no even for color ; he oupu was less han i expeced . 
baery[+1]##alhough canon 's baeries are proprieary , hey las a really long ime , recharge fairly quickly in he camera , plus if you wan ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare baeries righ here on amazon . 
if you love an slr 35mm bu need o go digial 
camera[+2]##his is a grea camera for you ! 
conrol[+2],auo mode[+2]##he canon g3 gives ons of conrol for phoo buffs bu sill has an " auo " mode ha makes i very easy for he novice o use . 
##i can hand his o anyone and know hey will ake some grea phoos ! 
conrol[+2]##i love having he opion o manually conrol he f-sop , shuer speed and even focus . 
phoo[+3]##i was able o ake grea phoos of he 4h of july fire works , and go some amazing shos of he kids playing wih sparklers . 
##warning - i did read he manual ! 
conrol[+2]##bu if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , he conrols are very inuiive ! 
##once i read he manual i was able o poin and shoo wihou having o fumble around rying o figure ou where he conrols are locaed . 
dial[+1]##wih a quick spin of he dial you can selec shuer prioriy ( for high speed subjecs ) , aperure prioriy ( for focal lengh ) or full program mode where he camera selecs boh for ideal phoo qualiy . 
manual mode[+2]##he manual mode is easy o use wih fas access for he selecion of shuer speed and aperure wihou having o fumble hrough menu opions .

feel[+2],weigh[+2]##his camera also has a grea feel and weigh o i . 
feel[+2]##you feel like you are holding somehing of subsance , no some cheap plasic oy . 
camera[+2][p]##he more i work wih i , he more i love i ! 
##i would recomend ha you purchase a lexar media cf for he camera as he sandisk card ha comes packaged is oo small and oo slow ! 
camera[+3][u]##i did n' hink i would find his qualiy and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm hrilled wih my purchase ! 
ousanding camera 
camera[+3]##his is my firs digial camera , and i am very pleased wih i . 
##i do no know a whole lo abou phoography , bu i am happy o know ha his camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge .

##if you wan , check ou he canon websie and hey have some sample images , aken by his camera , for you o download . 
##if you are looking for a very simple poin and shoo camera , his is probably no wha you are looking for . 
##if you are looking for an ousanding camera ha can ake you from simple o complex , his is i . 
produc[+3][u]##i is a very amazing produc . 
camera[+3][p]##i highly recommend i . 
love my new g 3 
feaure[+2]##jus received his camera wo days ago and already love he feaures i has . 
phoo[+2]##akes excellen phoos . 
nigh mode[+2]##nigh mode is clear as day . 
use[+1][u]##i have no played wih all he feaures ye , bu he camera is easy o use once you ge used o i . 
viewfinder[-1]##he only drawback is he viewfinder is slighly blocked by he lens . 
##however , using he lcd seems o eliminae his minor problem . 
camera[+3]##overall i is he bes camera on he marke . 
##i give i 10 sars ! 
noise level 
##his camera has significanly more noise a iso 100 han he nikon 4500 . 
he picures are brillien 
##i jus bough he camera a few days ago . 
##before i " ge used o i " , here are my firs feelings : 
picure qualiy[+3]##a ) he picure qualiy ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so grea , i compleely eliminaed my doub abou digial imaging --- how could one ea rice one grain a a ime : - ) ) 
lens cover[-2]##b ) he lens cover is surely loose , i already accidenly finger-prined he len a few imes , and au lens ig and cause poenial damage . 
##i wish canon would work ou some way for ha issue . 
zooming lever[-2]##he zooming lever is shaky , i hope i does no operae mechanically , oherwise you 'll feel uneasy . 
grea gadge 
##i bough his las week hrough amazon . 
##go a grea deal from a repuable seller . 
camera[+2]##i love his camera . 
##i am sill rying o figure ou he may opions i has . 
picure[+2]##ook hundreds of picures and hey were grea . 
color[+2],picure[+2],whie balance[+2]##grea colors , picures and whie balance . 
opical zoom[+1]##has 4x opical zoom which is higher han any oher in he same price range . 
##i is generally overpriced a lile bi bu you ge wha you are paying for . 
ok for a digial camera 
picure[-3][u]##maybe i is my lack of experience , bu i found shos wih his camera very disappoining . 
price[-3][u]##i was ( i sold i afer a few monhs ) oo expensive for he shos ha i go . 
camera[-2][u]##sure i had all he feaures , bu when i ried o shoo a girl 's baskeball game i jus wan' up o he ask . 
##i do n' hink i was asking oo much . 
##any film zoom p and s would have given superior resuls wih a minimal effor . 
##and wih he 500 you save you could prin he resuls for he life of he camera . 
camera[-3]##i found ha low ligh siuaions combined wih any sor of acion lef his camera in he dus . 
##i waned i o shoo concers as well . 
##ha mean even less ligh and jus as much acion . 
##sure , i adjused he film speed o 400 . 
grain[-3]##he grain was errible . 
##nex ime i se i a 100 and used he flash . 
flash phoo[-3],noise[-2]##well flash phoos are never grea , and here was sill a lo of noise . 
phoo[+3]##when i ook oudoor phoos wih pleny of ligh and he objecs were n' moving , he phoos were awesome . 
camera[+1]##he camera was a marvel . 
##geing he priner o help oupu hem was anoher ale . 
##overall i hink ha you need o consider wha you wan' o do . 
##for simple poin and shoo phoography , consider a cheaper digial . 
##you do n' need he exra resoluion or he cos . 
##hen again a one ime use camera may do jus as well . 
##if you shoo in los of ligh and desire high qualiy , his will be your camera . 
camera[+3][p]##i is versaile and seems o be one of he bes . 
##me , i am going wih a leica minilux ( he g3 was replacing mine which was solen ) . 
##sure . 
##i is less versaile , bu i am never disappoined wih he oupu . 
wihin is limiaions 
##i am a long-ime user of highly responsive film slrs and professional qualiy exernal flash equipmen , jus so you know my bias . 
##i have been waching he developmen of digicams for years , waiing o make my firs move . 
##wha i really wan is a $ 1,500 digial slr wih a full frame sensor ha will ake my nikon lenses . 
##i figure ha is a leas hree years off , and i am geing impaien . 
##hence i decided o spring for a poin-and-shoo digicam ha ha would have feaures ha would le me ge around heir inheren limiaions . 
g3[+1]##i chose he g3 because of is repuaion for very high qualiy , clean images . 
lag ime[-2],flash[-2]##he wo limiaions i knew i would have o deal wih are he very long lag ime before i focus-locks ( even in brigh ligh ) , and he unsaisfacory ligh qualiy of he buil-in flash . 
##as of his wriing , echnology has no solved he focus-lock lag ime problem for poin-and-shoo digicams and anyone who is saisfied wih i simply has never used a modern film slr . 
##a leas once youve go focus lock , he shuer release lag ime for he g3 is abou 1/10 of a second , which from wha ive read , is beer han jus abou anyhing else available . 
deph[+1]##wha makes he focus-lock lag ime somehing i can live wih is he exreme deph of field obainable wih hese poin and shoo digicams a f8 . 
##once i ge focus lock , i can hen wai unil my resless subjec ( a pe or a child ) srikes an amusing pose and hen fire he shuer wih some reasonable probabiliy of geing my subjec sill in focus . 
##now wha abou he flash problem ? 
flash[-2]##relaive o wha i can easily achieve wih exernal flash on my nikon slr , he inernal flash on he g3 produces harsh , fla images wih ugly ho spos . 
exernal flash ho shoe[+1]##forunaely , he g3 has a ho shoe ha can ake an exernal flash , and forunaely for me , i already owned a one of he highes qualiy exernal flashes ha money can buy : he mez 60 c-4 . 
##i can use my nikon exernal flash on a canon camera , bu i can use my mez , wih he proper mez module and exension cord conneced beween he g3 and he 60 c-4 . 
##for hose who have his mez flash ( or he 45cl-3 ) and would like o ge he absolue ulimae qualiy ou of his g3 , he mez module you need is he sca 3102 and he connecor cord is he sca 3000c . 
##in order for his o work , you have o se he camera o manual mode and se he shuer speed and f-sop yourself . 
flash[+2]##conrary o wha ive read elsewhere , he g3 does sync a 1/250 of a second wih hird-pary flashes , jus as i does wih he dedicaed flashes from canon . 
##you also have o se he g3 o second shuer sync , which is wha youd wan o do mos of he ime anyhow . 
##hen jus forge abou all he conrols you have on he mez flash head iself and he sca 3102 conrol panel , because hey are all ignored . 
##he g3 compleely akes over conrolling he duraion of he mez flash , and mos of he ime , he exposure is spo on and when i isn , is because youve exceeded he range of he mez flash iself . 
##his migh happen if you ge oo close o he subjec and you are no bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and he walls are simply oo far away . 
##unforunaely , he neural densiy filers for he mez flash are no longer available , so he firs problem can easily be solved . 
##he second problem is solved by more direc lighing from he mez ( wih he aendan shadows unforunaely ) . 
##bu once youve go your exposure wihin an accepable range , he g3 is shown o produce uerly sunning images ha i can hardly ge wih my nikon f100 film camera . 
##he 60 c-4 flash head can acually be reversed 180 degrees and hen iled , enabling you o bounce he flash off he walls behind you . 
##he resuls are shadow-free images ha look as if heyve been exposed wih he genles naural ligh you could imagine . 
sofware[-2]##now here is one more complain i have abou he g3 and ha is he sofware ha comes wih i for processing raw images ( i only shoo in raw image mode and he firs hing i did was replace he 32 mbye cf wih a 512 mbye cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed o 7 ! 
sofware[-2]##he canon sofware for raw images does no presen you wih a raw image a all , bu he raw image afer i has been processed by all he image-affecing seings in he camera . 
##i believe his is enabled by a second file ha comes ou of he camera ha sores all his informaion . 
##maybe if you delee hose files before you looked a hem wih he sofware , youd see he rue , raw image ha he camera acually produces . 
##i didn wai o experimen . 
##insead , i bough he adobe phooshop camera raw plug-in . 
g3[+3]##wha his plug-in reveals is he ruly sunning qualiy of he raw g3 hardware . 
color[+3]##wihou any weaking a all , if he exposure is accurae , he colors are as realisic as ive ever seen produced by film , and his is a raw image ! 
g3[+3],sofware[-2]##he adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again ha hardware is miles ahead of sofware . 
sofware[-2]##wha he g3 raw image sofware gives you is a fanasy world designed o please he uncriical . 
##wha he phooshop plug-in gives you is realiy , and hen if you wan fanasy , you can use phooshop o creae i . 
image[+3]##bu a leas youre saring wih he mos phoorealisic images ive ever seen from a camera . 
raw image[+3]##i am sunned and amazed a he qualiy of he raw images i am geing from his g3 ( in conjuncion wih my professional flash sysem ) , and can easily pu up wih he cameras limiaions , because ive never seen anyhing beer wihin is resoluion limis . 
knock your socks off grea 
camera[+2][p]##i 've had his for 3 monhs now , and i am pleased wih my decision . 
camera[+3]##his is he perfec camera for a phoo hobbies who wans o have easy poin and shoo abiliy as well . 
##my girlfriend loved using his camera so much as a poin and shoo ha i had o pry i ou of her hands mos of he ime . 
baery life[+1]##baery life , he drawback o mos digial cameras , o quoe k. reeves . 
##whoa .

viewfinder[-1],lcd[+2],camera[+3]##no perfec ( yes , he viewfinder can ge obsruced in insances.bu he lcd works well enough in hose insances ) , no he cheapes 4.0 mp , bu he bes 4.0 mp . 
##if you do n' believe me on ha , check he consumer repors review as well as he many digial camera review sies ou here . 
##or save ime and jus do i , you wo n' regre i . 
grea digial camera 
##afer reading he very posiive review of his camera in a leading consumer magazine , i decided o head here , o amazon , o read hrough he online reviews . 
##he objecions of he naysayers almos caused me o purchase a differen camera , bu , in he end , i figured i 'd give he g3 a ry .

sofware[+2]##3 . he remoe capure and fileviewer sofware bundled for phoo capure is mind-blowing . 
##looks sor of like picasa sofware ( google i if you don know ) in he inerface and is as easy o insall and operae as g2 's , bu more inuiive . 
shape[+1]##4 . he shape of his device is a lile squarer , wihou losing he weigh which means beer balance and less shaking while clicking . 
##a big plus in my book . 
##5 . he 1/200 sec , f5.6 + nd filer for highly exposed ( or very brighly li ) environmens . 
ligh auo correcion[+2]##he ligh auo-correcion is awesome . 
picure[+2]##you could ake a picure of a sone glining in he sun and sill avoid he shining glaze and ge he conours righ . 
##6 . he g2 's " color effec " exposure mode has now been removed , he replacemen is a selecable " effec func " menu opion available in all exposure modes . 
##here are six defaul seings ( off , vivid , sepia , neural , low sharpening , b & w ) as well as a ' cusom effec ' ha allows you o conrol sharpening , conras and sauraion . 
##7 . a new phoosich sofware for siching your pics ino a panoramic view . 
##i can of course buy such a ool off he shelves separaely bu helps if i comes wih my camera . 
##( looks quie nea oo suggesing ha canon may have , er , canonized i a bi ). 
whie offse[+2]##8 . perhaps inspired by he canon 's facory whie-correcion seings ( which were found lacking and had o be alered by a user before he whie edges from buildings ec could be cleaned ou ) , he g3 has much sharper whie offses . 
##in english , his means ha even sraigh ou of he box , you 'll be amazed a he pics you end up aking . 
##9 . in dim li environs he g2 could easily ouperform any oher camera , and hankfully g3 mainains his rep . 
##personally i believe i even ouperforms he g2 in erms of less haze and asonishingly real colors . 
g3[+3]##overall , he g3 delivers wha mus be considered he bes image qualiy of any curren > 4 megapixel digicams , from a deail , onal balance and color response poin of view . 
##here 's really very lile abou g3 images o criicize . 
##shor of he eos range from canon or he d100s from nikon ( boh slrs ) .
camera[+3][p]##his is quie simply he bes you can ask for . 
love he g2 
##i love my g2 so hough i would upgrade . 
##big misake . 
low ligh focus[-2]##he g3 had problems focusing in low ligh and would no ake he picure when he shuer was pressed bu afer he shuer had been released a few seconds . 
picure[-3]##go way oo many blurry picures . 
##i have reurned he g3 ( acually i ried wo of hem ) and have my g2 ! 
awesome pro-sumer camera 
##when shopping for digial cameras i looked a he nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and he canon g3 . 
##yes , all cameras excep g3 were 5mp bu i was looking for a lo more han jus megapixel power . 
##no only was i was shopping for a camera ha would sui my casual and arisic phoographic needs , i had o keep in mind ha my fiance waned o use his camera as well . 
##her main focus was having a camera ha is easy o undersand and use . 
##he nikon 's are grea cameras . 
##+ hey have grea opics ( cp5700 has grea opical zoom ) and feaures , no o menion ake grea picures . 
##- he drawbacks were ha hey were no user friendly for he casual phoographer , he lcd screen is a lile oo small , cp5000 does no ake phoos in raw forma . 
##olympus c5050 is a very solid camera wih a meal body . 
##+ akes sharp 5mp phoo 's , has grea feaures and relaively easy o use . 
##- i did n' care much for he iling lcd screen , i seemed very limied and no very usefull . 
##phoos had some arifacs and noise . 
##my fiance jus did n' like he way i fel in her hands . 
##we also looked a he fuji fps602 . 
##nice camera bu does n' ake as sharp as picures i hough hey would , and again . 
##fiance did n' like he feel . 
##he canon g3 . 
phoo[+3], use[+3], sofware[+2]##4mp , 4x opical zoom , akes absoluely beauiful phoos wih deail ha challenges all of he above 5mp cameras , easy o undersand and use ( has a grea swivel lcd screen ) , a lo of feaures and add-on opions , comes wih grea sofware ( no o be overlooked ) , and las bu by far no leas , received my fiance 's samp of approval ( wo humbs up ! ) 
##a lo of research wen ino digial camera 's before i made his purchase , and hands down , he g3 had everyhing i needed plus more . 
##he oher cameras were grea and i 'm sure many people will beg o differ from my observaions , bu o each his / her own . 
##i have no buyers remorse wih his baby , and i never will . 
##always remember , cameras do n' ake grea picures , people do ! 
upgraded from g2 and no looking back 
camera[+2]##he powersho g3 is a grea camera . 
##why ? 
phoo[+3]##because i can help a so-so phoographer ake specacular phoos ! 
camera[+2]##4 megapixels is pleny for all bu pros , and you will no be disappoined wih he resuls of his camera . 
feaure[+1]##i 's slighly ligher han he g2 and packed wih even more feaures . 
##make sure you ge a big compacflash card ( i comes wih a 32mb ) -- he 512mb cards are prey [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold abou 500 phoos a a ime ! 
he cach 
unresponsiveness[-2]##he cach wih he canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digial cameras ) is ha is unresponsiveness will cause you o miss precious shos . 
##prior o he purchase , none of my digial camera friends menioned he delay beween pressing he shuer buon and he camera aking he picure . 
##no one old me , bu i waned o ell you . 
##his is no he same hing as a film camera . 
##and while i is cool and fun and has no film processing coss . 
##hey have n' go all he bugs worked ou jus ye . 
##mos of he ime , my g3 is a well-behaved camera . 
##bu once in a while , i run up agains i 's major flaw : 
delay[-1][u]##i someimes akes he picure a some indefinie period of ime afer you press he shuer buon . 
##i am no alking milliseconds . 
##picure his : 
##your child is going o do a cannonball off he diving board , so you compose he sho and wai for your momen . 
##when i arrives , you press he shuer release . 
##splash ! 
##he momen passes , and hen your new g3 camera akes he sho . 
##perhaps here is a way around his delay . 
##some feaure i could urn on or off , or some aachmen i could ge . 
##yes , i push he buon down halfway firs o avoid he auofocus delay . 
##yes , i have red-eye off , and yes , i 've ried adding a flash . 
##bu afer rying many adjusmens , he camera remains unresponsive when compared o any film-based camera . 
##i own anoher canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera . 
##i focuses in a snap . 
##dim or brigh , i would never ake a picure afer he birhday candles had blown ou , afer he ae kwon do kick broke he board . 
delay[-2][u]##canon 's g3 does i consisenly . 
focus[-2], shoo[-2]##i feels slow o focus , and unbearably slow o shoo . 
##i challenge anyone ( who is no in direc sun a he beach a noon ) o say i is fas and responsive . 
##and so i mus ask , wha are cameras for ? 
##wha ask do hey perform ? 
##cameras capure momens . 
##hey sop ime . 
##because once he momen is gone , i is no coming back . 
##he dive , he kick , he blow-ou-he-candles momens are , o me , he reason for cameras . 
##a 35mm film camera capures he momens you wan , while hese digial cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem o capure he momen immediaely following he one you asked o capure . 
##no all he ime , bu ofen enough o be a real problem . 
##like i said , when he momen is gone , i is gone . 
##so buy he g3 . 
##buy i for fun , for lack of processing , because you wan o use iphoo , or whaever . 
##bu do no assume , as i did , ha he g3 has he same abiliy as [ your curren film camera ] o sop he momen you choose . 
##from a dime sore disposable o a op of he line eos , all film cameras share his abiliy o capure he momen you ell hem o . 
g3[-2]##unforunaely , his digial momen-capuring device called he g3 someimes capures he momen afer he one you waned . 
100 % happy 
camera[+3]##his is my firs digial camera and i could n' be happier . 
##i have bu plan on selling my rebel i and all of he equipmen wih i . 
picure qualiy[+2]##i love he qualiy of he picures . 
picure qualiy[+2][p]##hey look fanasic . 
##i can ake beer picures wih his hen my rebel i wih a good lens . 
##i 's jus easier for me since i can make on he fly adjusmens . 
he bes 4mp ou here 
4mp camera[+2]##he canon g3 is perhaps he bes 4mp camera ou here . 
##i 've ried he sony s85 wih he carl zeiss lens , bu he picures were oo digial . 
picure[+2]##wih canon , you ge picures ha appear o be phoos , no sill camcorder shos . 
conrol[+2],menu[+2]##i love he eos based conrols and easy menus . 
##i do n' need o go ino exhusive review of his camera . 
##many before me have done ha already . 
##i agree wih he posiive reviews . 
##bu here are wo hings i do n' like abou he camera ha were no menioned in any previous reviews . 
lens cap[-2]##1 ) he included lens cap is very loose on he camera . 
##hough he insrucion bookle says ha he camera should display " lens " when he cap and he camera are boh on , he camera lens exends ou and simply akes he lens cap off by iself . 
##i 'm concerned ha wih he easily removed lens cap , i may damage he lens . 
##very cheaply made . 
body[-2]##2 ) he body consrucion - buons , casing , ec , are oo plasic . 
##he g2 was beer in his respec . 
casing[-2]##i had a heavier and more surdy casing . 
##despie hese grieps , i sill recommend he camera . 
love i more and more 
##i used a canon powersho s20 for abou 2.5 years and loved i ! 
##here were a few flaws ha i learned o deal wih and ook housands of picures around he world , losing a few ha i really regreed . 
##i finally decided o upgrade , and sared my research . 
##canon was an obvious choice , bu i did no wan o limi my decision , so sared researching all brands ha would ake my microdrives . 
##i researched , held , esed , and observed 3 differen brands . 
##needless o say , he canon won , hands down . 
##his camera performs like i can no believe ! 
performance[+3][p]##i bough i for my rip o beunos aires , and also used i a he iguazu falls , and could no have asked for more perfec performance ! 
##i was oo new o have learned much abou he advanced feaures , so i generally used he auo mode . 
camera[+3]##his camera is worh every penny , and i highly recommend i ! 
baery life[+3]##anoher poin of noe : he baery life is incredible ! 
##i did no have a backup baery , and had no need for one . 
##i did have abiliy o charge i every nigh , so do n' know how long i would have acually gone before dying . 
##his camera will say wih me for years ! 
he las digial camera i 'll buy 
##i 've been looking o buy a digial camera for a long ime and v = finally decided ha now was he ime . 
##afer a lo of research , i decided on he g3 . 
camera[+2]##am i ever glad ha i decided on his camera ! 
camera[+2]##i 've only had i a week , bu so far , everyhing abou his camera is making me happy . 
##forge he fac ha i 'll probably ake me a year o figure ou all he feaures his camera has o offer . 
##i 've been able o change modes on his hing wihou even looking a he manual . 
menu[+2]##very inuiive menus are a big plus on his camera . 
##i charged i up he day i go i , ook a bunch of picures and i do n' hink he baery indicaor has budged from fully charged . 
baery[+2]##he sandard baery include wih he g3 is a camcorder baery ha will allow me o ake picures all day wihou worrying abou charging . 
##i was worried abou his afer seeing a friend change baeries on his olympus afer abou 20-30 picures . 
opical zoom[+3],viewfinder[+1]##he opical zoom is awesome , and he viewfinder reflecs he seings of he zoom . 
viewfinder[-2]##one lile minor flaw wih his camera is ha he lens is visible in he viewfinder , bu does no derac from he image a all . 
##as i said , his is he las digial camera i 'll buy , and if you are in he marke one , my advice is o buy he bes hing you can afford and keep i forever . 
##hese hings may ge a lo beer in he fuure , bu from wha i 've seen in he las few years , he echnology for digial cameras is n' advancing a he pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives . 
camera[+3]##he bes 4 megapixel/4x opical zoom camera available and fairly easy o use . 
##highly recommended . 
##for more info on digial cameras , go o dpreviews . 
boxy ? no -- gorgeous 
##you can read he oher reviews for specs and performance opinions . 
##i was perfecly happy wih my g2 , so why did i rade up o he g3 ? 
camera[+3]##because his camera is beauiful . 
##he g2 was slighly curvy wih a champagne finish -- very homely . 
look[+3]##he g3 looks like a work of ar ! 
finish[+3]##is silver magnesium finish is sunning , and he sharp lines and excellen grip are beer han any oher camera i 've seen . 
##he lile digial elphs were he bes-designed , mos-elegan cameras unil he g3 came along and squashed hem . 
very good choice in i 's price range 
##his is my firs digial camera . 
camera[+2][p]##i am very pleased wih i so far . 
##i waned somehing ha is able o ake high qualiy phoos bu no be so bulky ha i would wind up leaving i a home all he ime . 
##his seemed like a really good compromise . 
##i compared i o he olympus c5050z , he sony dcs-f 717 and he nikon 5700 . 
##based on he cameras feaures and abou dozen online reviews , his one seemed like he bes all round deal . 
##i is no perfec hough . 
##here are he shorcomings i have noiced so far : 
##i would have been a much easier choice if his were 5mp camera . 
viewfinder[-2]##you can see he lens barrel in he view-finder . 
iff forma[-2]##( i knew his before hand , and i is no ha bad ) here is no iff forma . 
##ha would be a nice compromise beween jpeg and raw . 
##o save a picure as raw , you have o have he display on , his seems like a wase of baery power . 
lag[-2]##i seems o me ha afer he focus and meering are complee here is quie a lag before he shuer ? 
##rips . 
##( again his is my firs digial camera and maybe ha is jus how hey all are . ) 
##for hose of you using a mac in os x+ here is no wain uiliy o download your pics direcly ino phooshop . 
impor[+2]##i is very simple o impor via iphoo 2 and hen move hem o phooshop . 
##i have no spen much ime wih he included sofware , so i don' know wha o say abou i oher han i seems ok . 
camera[+2]##i am quie happy wih he camera .

camera[+3]##bes camera ever . from he image qualiy , color , funcion , i can say almos everyhing . 
sich picure[+2]##his camera has a cool sich picures feaure , o find ou more jus log on o canon 's websie . 
##i had an olympus digial camera before and i was nohing compared o his . 
##for hose of you who already bough his camera , i sugges you buy a hi-i dye-sub phoo priner . 
you 'll ake more pics 
##i do n' wrie many reviews bu i 'm compelled o do so wih his camera . 
picure[+2]##firs and foremos , i will ake beer pic 's han mos film camera 's . 
##save hem on compuer and prin ou jus he ones who wan . 
##duplicaes are a no brainer and cheap . 
##no more wased ime and money developing rolls of pic 's for jus a couple of keepers . 
##crop and enlarge he bes a pracically no exra cos or ime . 
##he echnology is finally here folks , o make your phoo life easier . 
##a grea new use for ha underuilized compuer . 
##a digial camera will say a home if is a hassle o use . 
##poor qualiy pics , shor baery life , slow ime consuming uploads and prining will ruin he digial camera experience and keep you buying film . 
camera[+2]##his camera has none of hese flaws and will be somehing you 'll use all he ime . 
##my wife shuns all new echnology and compained when i brough his home , bu now she 's forever asking for he digial camera . 
##and i le my kids shoo as many pics as hey wan , le hem review hem on he camera and jus prin he good ones ( which are no many ) . 
##ge he canon 850 priner and an ex flash . 
##in shor , i have a new slr wih an expensive lens and several film poin and shoos . 
##i have n' used any of hem since i go he g3 . 
##unless your a professional , now you will need only one camera . his one . 
excellen camera 
##i spen a lo of ime comparing differen cameras , and i realized ha here is no such hing as he bes digial camera . 
##you can always spend more money o ge a beer one . 
camera[+3]##however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budge , i hink his camera is an excellen choice . 
design[+2], feaure[+2],use[+1][u],baery[+2]##i has a beauiful design , los of feaures , very easy o use , very configurable and cusomizable , and he baery duraion is amazing ! 
display[+2]##also , he display is " hinged " and i can be placed in a myriad of posiions , or o proec i agains any damage . 
##excellen idea ! 
compacflash[-2]##one bad hing is ha i comes wih a piiful 32mb compacflash card , and for mos purposes , i is no enough . 
##however , i seems ha his is he general rule for mos digial cameras . 
noise[+2]##anoher good hing is ha his camera seems o inroduce much less noise in dark places han ohers i 've seen . 
cannon 
camera[+2]##i have owned his camera for a shor ime and would n' give i up for anyhing . 
camera[+2]##i surpasses my greaes expecaions in a 4mp camera .. 
powerful produc 
##bough his produc abou a monh ago and have used i in a variey of siuaions . 
use[+1][u],design[+1][u]##in general i is easy o use and well laid ou . 
##for `` cool facor '' buffs i looks and feels like a small plasic brick brick and does n' have any wow facor . 
use[+3],conrol[+2]##i makes up for his by being exremely easy o use wih well laid ou conrols ha can be learned quickly . 
feaure[+2]##he g3 has mos if no all of he feaures ha you would wan from a semi-pro / pro slr wih a good range of manual opions for hose who know somehing abou phoography . 
auo mode[+1]##in he hands of someone who does n' , i will yield good resuls on idio program / auo mode . 
##my wife , who has never used a camera before , picked i up and soon go he hang of he fac ha if you do n' like wha you have creaed you jus delee and ry again . 
##he phoos she ook are beer han he resuls i go from my nikon slr and range of lenses ! 
##his is a big plus for hose who a shifing o digial and he g3 's large mobile screen helps wih his . 
##negaive poins : 
memory card[-2]##he included memory card is oo small . 
##go ou and ge a 256meg card , i 's worh he expense . 
made[-2]##i is made of plasic . 
##for hose who are used o brass cameras ha can be dropped , picking up a camera like he g3 is an unnerving experience . 
##his is by no means unique o his model , i 'm sure . 
lens[-1]##he zoom lens uni feels fragile and i is worh buying a good camera bag if you are going pu o carry i round a lo . 
##his is no a handbag camera . 
size[-1][u]##while ligh , i will no easily go in small handbags or pockes . 
lever[-1]##he funcion lever - he one which swiches beween capure and view mode feels fragile . 
flash[-1]##flash - as wih all buil-in flashes in small cameras , you ge overilluminaed main subjecs wih deph being los . 
##he g3 has a shoe which will ake oher powerful ( and expensive ) canon flashes ha will allow bounce and refleced flash phoography . 
srap[-2]##he srap is horrible and ges in he way of pars of he camera you need access o . 
##if you can afford his camera , you can afford o ge a beer srap elsewhere - a very minor quibble . 
##good poins : 
camera[+2]##he funcionaliy on his camera is mind-blowing . 
opion[+1}, conrol[+1]##canon have packed a lo in here and he opions and conrols are easy o use and logically laid ou . 
learning[+1]##learning how o use i will no ake very long . 
image qualiy[+3]##he image qualiy is excellen . 
##messing around wih images in phooshop ( a supplied sofware package ) and prining hem on a good priner , yielded excellen resuls . 
##unless you are making posers , a g3 is more han good enough . 
funcion[+1]##range of funcions - as indicaed above - i has somehing for everyone : poin and shoo power plus advanced funcions for hose who are serious abou phoography . 
##please noe ha his is he firs digial camera i have owned or used . 
##a lo of my opinions are more relevan for hose who are swiching from film . 
##i did exensive research before chosing he g3 bu here 's nohing like picking one up and playing wih i firs . 
bes camera i 've used 
camera[+2]##his is by far he fines camera in is price and caegory i have ever used . 
##i is also one of he few elecronic iems ha works righ ou of he box . 
macro[+2], auo mode[+2]##he macro works grea for medical phoographs and he auo mode is errific for poin and shoo . 
his camera is closes o perfec han any oherdigicam 
camera[+2]##his camera is closes o perfec han any oher digicam ha is 4-5 megapixel . 
##beas ha sony f717 ; is archrival . 
4mp resoluion[+1]##i 'm glad canon decided o keep he 4mp resoluion and improved upon i wih new echnology ; 
##i can ' fi all ha resoluion ( 4mp = 2272x 1704 resol . ) in my 19in fla monior ( 1200x1024 resol . ) anyways . 
##please go o read dpreview.com and you 'll ge he complee sory . 
##my sory is based on personal usage . 
disorion[-1][u]##yes here is a corner lens barrel disorion ( i do n' like i oo bu no harm done since i always use he camea lcd screen o see exacly wha i 'm going o ge ) in he viewfinder when you do n' zoom ( when you zoom he lens disorion goes away ) , canon knows his and engineered i ha way o minimize he parallax phenomenon ; ha is wha lmos exacly o he picure . 
##moving he viewfinder elsewhere on he camera will remove he lens disorion bu increase he parallax phenomenon . 
##he disorion is no a flaw . 
##as wih aking digial picures , i noice oher people including myself have errors on heir compacflash which resuls in cerain shos being parially aken or los - his is an issue ha seems o effec compacflash and oher digicam brand . 
##i 've have n' heard abou a diagnos or fix for his . 
sho[+2]##in erms of he shos aken , his camera is insanely grea ! 
picure[+3],learning curve[+1]##he picures are fabulous and heir is a ( shor ) learning curve o i ; here are ons of feaures i have n' even goen o . 
##in erms of he imporan accessories , i go myself an he exra liium baery . 
##based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for a leas 255 shos . 
##i also go myself a 512mb viking compac flash ( enough for 255 shos a full 4mp resoluion and max picure qualiy ) and a used $ 250 3lb subnoebook wih usb connecion and ons of hard drive space for long rips so i can verify wha i 've aken and ha subnoebook also saves me from having o buy exra compacflash . 
##he compac flash is delicae and i hae o swap i in fear on he conneions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead o cf erros ) or losing i . 
##anyways , canon has improved upon he g2 wih his g3 . 
##i 's a winner . 
picure qualiy[+2]##i 've been pleased wih he picure qualiy and durabiliy in snow , car , boa and wind . 
##my only suggesion is o ge a lens proecor o help proec he shooing lens ( he lens coaing will wear ou afer so many clean wipes ) and i 'm geing he hose ( 52 mm adaper and uv lens filer ) a lensmaeonline.com . 
##hey go he bes lens adaper for he g3-beer han canon 's . 
##ha 's wha i did and hopes his helps . 
canon g3 review / response / recommendaion 
camera[+2]##he camera 's a work of ar / science -- ha 's undersood . 
picure[+2],feel[+1][u]##i akes grea picures , operaes quickly , and feels solid . 
viewfinder[-2]##o address wo previous somewha negaive reviews : ( 1 ) yes , he lens barrel does obsruc par of he lower lef corner in he lens viewfinder ; however , he lcd viewfinder is raher sunning and i find myself rarely using he lens viewfinder . 
##( 2 ) here are , acually , several differences beween he g2 and g3 , such as differences in coninuous shooing , he opical lens , he conrol layou , playback zoom , image processing , and so on . 
beware 
##you see , i can ' rank he produc since he merchan ha amazon is collaboraing wih ( j and r camera . ) o bring us consumers beer choices never sen me he produc . 
##alhough you may hink you 're dealing wih amazon , you 're dealing wih some second rae sore ha you 've never heard of . 
##afer charging my card for he camera and for expedied shipping , 5 business days laer , hey sill had n' shipped he produc . 
##i called hem wice and boh imes hey said i is " abou o ship " . 
##one of he calls was on a saurday and when i pressed he guy a bi , he said , " acually we do n' ship on saurdays " . 
##so why lie abou i ? 
##so i finally gave hem a deadline which hey said hey could mee . 
##alhough hey acceped ha hey will ship on mon - 6 jan , hey sill did n' ship i . 
##hey said i is in sock , bu hey are " oo busy " . 
##hey were n' busy enough o charge he credi card , hough ! 
##alhough i ried conacing amazon o see if hey can do anyhing , he replies i go were inep as if hey had n' aken ime o read he complain . 
##i cancelled he order . 
##hope o ge my refund in a imely manner . 
##hanks for nohing , amazon ! 
major design flaw 
design[-3]##his camera has a major design flaw . 
viewfinder[-2]##when you look hrough he viewfinder ( no he lcd ) he boom lef corner of he picure ( abou 15 % ) is blocked by he lens . 
##i called he canon echnical service cener o see if i had a defecive camera . 
##afer abou a minue of rying o ell me ha mos people use he lcd and no he view finder , hey finally admied , i was a design flaw in he camera . 
camera[+2]##everyhing else abou he camera is grea . 
camera[+2]##if you sricly use he lcd and no he view finder , i highly recommend he camera . 
##however for me , i occasionally use he view finder and rying o frame in a picure wih he lens blocking he view is oo much . 
##i 'm sending mine back and am waiing for he problem o be correced . 
i love i more he longer i own i 
##i 've been using a powersho s330 for nearly a year , and waned o upgrade o a 4 or 5 megapixel camera wih a longer zoom , more adjusabiliy , a ho shoe for an exernal flash , and a remoe conrol . 
##i looked a boh he nikon coolpix 5700 and he canon g3 , and decided on he g3 due boh o ergonomics ( much more comforable o hold and use ) and he price . 
##i 've had he camera for abou wo weeks and sho hundreds of picures so far . 
camera[+3][u]##and so far , i 've been very pleased . 
##here 's a noiceable difference in he qualiy of a 4 megapixel image versus he 2 megapixels of he s330 , especially if you wan o crop and enlarge he picures . 
lens[+2],opical zoom[+1]##he larger lens of he g3 gives beer picure qualiy in low ligh , and he 4-imes opical zooms ges you jus ha much closer . 
lcd[+2]##he moveable lcd screen is grea . 
##you can ake picures wih he camera held above your head , way down , or beside you wih no problem , allowing you o posiion he camera for he bes sho wihou conoring yourself . 
remoe[+2]##he iny ( posage-samp sized ) remoe uni is wonderful : no only does i rigger he shuer , i can also be used o zoom and review picures . 
##i also purchased a good surdy ripod : he combinaion of he new camera , ripod and remoe conrol enabled me o ake some remarkable indoor , naural-ligh porrais i never would have aemped before . 
ho shoe flash[+1]##he ho shoe flash aachmen allowed me o buy and use a sophisicaed flash uni : 
##i chose he canon speedlie 420 . 
##his has made he greaes difference in he qualiy of my phoographs : he buil-in flash on any of hese cameras gives you fla phoos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash uni can be bounced off he ceiling or wall for pleasing , almos-naural lighing . 
baery[+2]##i needed hree baeries o keep myself going wih he s330 , bu he baery in he g3 is a real powerhouse : 
##i sho over 300 phoos a my goddaugher 's birhday pary wihou swiching ou o my backup baery . 
baery charging sysem[+1]##he g3 has a differen ype of baery charging sysem from he smaller canon cameras : he baery needs o be charged while in he camera , bu he charging sysem also enables you o use he camera while plugged in wihou running down he baery . 
manual[+1]##i have ye o ry using all of he adjusmen opions : shuer prioriy , aperaure prioriy , ligh meering adjusmens , ec. , bu all conrols are well hough ou and and he manual is relaively clear . 
##you can use his camera righ ou of he box on he auomaic seing , or slowly ge comforable wih he manual seings and wha hey can do . 
##negaives ? 
highligh[-1]##i 've been bohered by blown-ou highlighs on he s330 , and he g3 seems o do only slighly beer . 
##( i 'm saring o hink ha his may jus be one of he weaknesses of all digial phoography a his level . ) 
no-off buon[-2]##he on-off buon feels somewha flimsy , and has an awkward , iny lile lock-ou buon ha needs o be depressed o urn on he camera . 
body[-2]##and he body / consrucion in general has quie a bi of plasic , a disappoinmen afer he sainless seel hef of he s330 . 
##i bough a 512 mb card , which seems o hold abou 400 phoos a he highes resoluion . 
download[+1]##i was worried ha 4 megapixel phoos would download more slowly , bu here 's no difference in working wih he files . 
##i have a 120 gb remoe drive i use o sore my digial images : 
##i can imagine ha hey 'd fill up my ibook 's inernal memory prey quickly . 
##a he same ime i purchased his camera i also bough adobe 's phooshop elmens 2.0 sofware , and can ' praise i highly enough . 
##if you 're invesing in a camera a his level , buy his sofware ! 
##and as i said in my review of he s330 , all of hese digial cameras are easier o use wih apple compuers . 
##he boom line : if you 're serious abou your digial phoography , or been bien wih he bug afer using a digial poin-and-shoo , his may be jus he camera for you . 
##bu make sure o buy a ripod and separae flash uni a he same ime : you 'll see he difference in your phoos immediaely . 
##added 2-24 . 
camera[+3]##i 've now had he camera for wo monhs and i 'm even more pleased wih i . 
##i wound up buying a gray card and use i all he ime wih he cusom whie-balance seing . 
##i helps avoid he problem of a color cas on he picures , especially in mixed-ligh seings . 
##if you do n' have a gray card , you can use a plain whie piece of paper . 
##i also discovered he exposure-bracke seing , which enables you o ake hree exposures wih one press of he shuer : he firs a he camera-deermined exposure , hen one ligher and one darker . 
##especially useful wih porrais and difficul-o-meer siuaions . 
##i did buy he elephoo lens ( and he required exension ) . 
##very easy o use . 
##i 'll probably also ge he wide-angle now , oo . 
camera[+3],use[+1],phoo[+3]##very comforable camera , easy o use , and he bes digial phoos you 're going o ge a his price . 
bes non-slr digial camera under 5 megapixels 
g3[+2]##i 've been using he g3 for abou six weeks and i has proven iself o be all ha i 's adverised . 
##afer doing a hands-on comparison beween he nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dsc-f 717 ( boh of which lack he qualiy , feel , or feaures of he g3 ) , i ulimaely chose he g3 because of is ousanding image qualiy ( resoluion and coloraion are superior ) . 
##i beas he compeiion in almos every area including baery life , enhusias feaures , exernal flash capabiliies , available sorage ypes , image formas , and more . 
##his is a camera you will need o sudy and use in order o fully exploi is many feaures . 
##i can be a poin-and-shoo camera , bu if you do no inend o " ge ino " i 's finer feaures , i 'd sugges a less enhusias feaured choice . 
camera[+3]##all-in-all , i believe his is arguably he bes non-slr digial camera on he marke . 
he bes so far 
##he canon g3 improves in almos all ways on he g1 and g2 before i , and in fac beas he nikon coolpix 5000 in performance ( picure qualiy and baery life ) -- which is amazing because he 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and he canon is a 4 megapixel camera . 
opic[+2]##canon 's opics are beer and i believe heir processing algorihms are also beer . 
digial camera[+3]##simply , he canon g3 is he bes digial camera ou here oday a his price poin . 
##he canon allows you o change lenses , and i acceps he ibm microdrive ( ype ii compac flash ) , so you can have up o 1 gigabye of sorage . 
##for me on he fine resoluion seing ( no maximum bu very close ) his adds up o over 1000 images wih he 1 gig card . 
baery life[+2]##he baery life of his camera is wice ha of he nikon 5000 and is beer han anyhing else i 've seen . 
look[-2]##he only minor nis i have wih he camera are i is fairly boxy looking , i needs a wris srap insead of a neck srap , and i is a bi slow beween shos . 
camera[+3]##even wih hese shorcomings , i sill hink i is he bes digial camera available under $ 1200 . 
grea camera bu g2 will do he same for less 
camera[+3]##defineely a grea camera . 
qualiy[+2],lens[+2]##proven canon buil qualiy and lens . 
feel[+2]##feels solid in hand . 
weigh[-1],camera[+2]##raher heavy for poin and shoo bu a grea camera for semi pros .
